# Another JS Boilerplate
## Node / Express / Mongoose / Jest / AirBnB ESlint

- The server will run endoint `GET /users`, returns some data from preconfigured mlab MongoDB instance.
- AirBnB's superior ES-lint rules ^_^
- Test template for `jest` tests (No, `jest` is not for React only)


# Run server
`yarn start` - runs server


# Run tests
`yarn test` - run concurrently both unit and integrations tests

# Run dev server
`yarn dev` - runs `nodemon` which reloads the server on any detected changes
